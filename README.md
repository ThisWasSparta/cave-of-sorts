# Cave of Sorts

This repo contains the C# code I wrote for my Unity game Cave of Sorts, a mobile puzzle game.
Gameplay of which can be found on my website https://skeletonmakesgames.onrender.com/#/game-projects

Feel free to use any code you see here in any non commercial, personal projects/educational contexts. 
In the off chance you do, feel free to reach out, I'd love to see whatever you make. :)

Most of the interesting gameplay stuff happens in the MatchResolver and AnimationCoordinator. 
A good starting point for understanding the way the games manages/transitions between states is, of course, the GameManager class.
