# Cave of Sorts

This repo contains the C# code I wrote for my Unity game Cave of Sorts, a mobile puzzle game, last updated on the 1st of April. (April fools I guess? Here's some code)
Feel free to use any code you see here in any non commercial, personal projects/educational contexts. 
In the off chance you do, feel free to reach out, I'd love to see whatever you make. :)

Most of the interesting gameplay stuff happens in the MatchResolver, AnimationCoordinator and of course, the GameManager classes.
